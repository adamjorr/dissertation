          Read-based phasing allows to reconstruct the haplotypes of a sample purely from sequencing reads. While phasing is an important step for answering questions about population genetics, compound heterozygosity, and to aid in clinical decision making, there has been a lack of accurate, usable and standards-based software.
          {WhatsHap} is a production-ready tool for highly accurate read-based phasing. It was designed from the beginning to leverage third-generation sequencing technologies, whose long reads can span many variants and are therefore ideal for phasing. {WhatsHap} works also well with second-generation data, is easy to use and will phase not only {SNVs}, but also indels and other variants. It is unique in its ability to combine read-based with pedigree-based phasing, allowing to further improve accuracy if multiple related samples are provided.},

	abstract = {In plants, gametogenesis occurs late in development, and somatic mutations can therefore be transmitted to the next generation. Longer periods of growth are believed to result in an increase in the number of cell divisions before gametogenesis, with a concomitant increase in mutations arising due to replication errors. However, there is little experimental evidence addressing how many cell divisions occur before gametogenesis. Here, we measured loss of telomeric {DNA} and accumulation of replication errors in
              Arabidopsis
              with short and long life spans to determine the number of replications in lineages leading to gametes. Surprisingly, the number of cell divisions within the gamete lineage is nearly independent of both life span and vegetative growth. One consequence of the relatively stable number of replications per generation is that older plants may not pass along more somatically acquired mutations to their offspring. We confirmed this hypothesis by genomic sequencing of progeny from young and old plants. This independence can be achieved by hierarchical arrangement of cell divisions in plant meristems where vegetative growth is primarily accomplished by expansion of cells in rapidly dividing meristematic zones, which are only rarely refreshed by occasional divisions of more quiescent cells. We support this model by 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine retention experiments in shoot and root apical meristems. These results suggest that stem-cell organization has independently evolved in plants and animals to minimize mutations by limiting {DNA} replication.},
