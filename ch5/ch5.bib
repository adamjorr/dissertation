	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Standardized benchmarking methods and tools are essential to robust accuracy assessment of {NGS} variant calling. Benchmarking variant calls requires careful attention to definitions of performance metrics, sophisticated comparison approaches, and stratification by variant type and genome context. To address these needs, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ({GA}4GH) Benchmarking Team convened representatives from sequencing technology developers, government agencies, academic bioinformatics researchers, clinical laboratories, and commercial technology and bioinformatics developers for whom benchmarking variant calls is essential to their work. This team addressed challenges in (1) matching variant calls with different representations, (2) defining standard performance metrics, (3) enabling stratification of performance by variant type and genome context, and (4) developing and describing limitations of high-confidence calls and regions that can be used as “truth”. Our methods are publicly available on {GitHub} (https://github.com/ga4gh/benchmarking-tools) and in a web-based app on {precisionFDA}, which allow users to compare their variant calls against truth sets and to obtain a standardized report on their variant calling performance. Our methods have been piloted in the {precisionFDA} variant calling challenges to identify the best-in-class variant calling methods within high-confidence regions. Finally, we recommend a set of best practices for using our tools and critically evaluating the results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Unfortunately, these comparisons are not straightforward with the current Variant Call Files ({VCF}), which are the standard output of most variant calling algorithms for high-throughput sequencing data. Comparisons of {VCFs} are often confounded by the different representations of indels, {MNPs}, and combinations thereof with {SNVs} in complex regions of the genome, resulting in misleading results. A variant caller is inherently a classification method designed to score putative variants with confidence scores that could permit controlling the rate of false positives ({FP}) or false negatives ({FN}) for a given application. Receiver operator curves ({ROC}) and the area under the {ROC} ({AUC}) are efficient metrics to evaluate a test call set versus a gold standard. However, in the case of {VCF} data this also requires a special accounting to deal with discrepant representations. We developed a novel algorithm for comparing variant call sets that deals with complex call representation discrepancies and through a dynamic programing method that minimizes false positives and negatives globally across the entire call sets for accurate performance evaluation of {VCFs}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Availability{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}{RTG} Tools is implemented as a multithreaded Java application and source code is available under {BSD} license at: https://github.com/{RealTimeGenomics}/rtg-tools{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Contact{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}len@realtimegenomics.com{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Supplementary information{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Supplementary data are available at \textit{Bioinformatics online}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations can have important effects on the life history, ecology, and evolution of plants, but the rate at which they accumulate is poorly understood and difficult to measure directly. Here, we develop a method to measure somatic mutations in individual plants and use it to estimate the somatic mutation rate in a large, long-lived, phenotypically mosaic Eucalyptus melliodora tree. Despite being 100 times larger than Arabidopsis, this tree has a per-generation mutation rate only ten times greater, which suggests that this species may have evolved mechanisms to reduce the mutation rate per unit of growth. This adds to a growing body of evidence that illuminates the correlated evolutionary shifts in mutation rate and life history in plants.},
