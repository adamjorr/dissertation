The modern, effcient data structures these tools use enables researchers with a reference sequence to sample many more individuals with lower computing storage and processing overhead.

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic {DNA}. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic {DNA}, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by {PCR} with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The {PCR} products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single {DNA} molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single {DNA} strands of two closely spaced {CpG} dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm {DNA} an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

	abstract = {Although many genome sequences have been determined, identification of genes and their elements such as untranslated regions ({UTRs}), introns, and coding regions is still a significant challenge. We have developed a novel sequencing-based method called {RNA}-Seq in which {cDNA} fragments are subjected to high throughput sequencing using the Illumina platform, and short reads are computationally mapped to the genome to identify the transcribed regions. We have successfully applied {RNA}-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome. We demonstrate that most (74.5\%) of the unique sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We used this method to globally map 5′ {UTR} and 3′ {UTR} boundaries and confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Our results suggest an alternative initiation codon from that annotated for a number of known genes and demonstrate that many yeast genes contain upstream open reading frames ({uORFs}). We also found unexpected 3′ end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. We also found many novel transcribed regions not identified by other methods. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated. Furthermore, {RNA}-Seq is demonstrated to be at least as accurate as {DNA} microarrays for quantifying {RNA} expression levels and has a much larger dynamic range. We expect that {RNA}-Seq will be a valuable general approach for high resolution mapping of transcriptomes in many organisms.},

To map these protein-{DNA} interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay ({ChIPSeq}) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput {DNA} sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor ({NRSF}; also known as {REST}, for repressor element–1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [±50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical {NRSF}-binding motifs. These {ChIPSeq} data also have high sensitivity and specificity [{ROC} (receiver operator characteristic) area ≥ 0.96] and statistical confidence (P {\textless}10–4), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.

Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the {dNTPs} allows continuous observation of {DNA} synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to {DNA} secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position.

Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error ({SSE}) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) {GGC} sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded {DNA} and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as {RNA}-seq and {ChIP}-seq. Moreover, {SSE} is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly.

As is the case for microarrays and other high-throughput technologies, data from new high-throughput sequencing technologies are subject to technological and biological biases and systematic errors that can impact downstream analyses. Only when these issues can be readily identified and reliably adjusted for will clinical applications of these new technologies be feasible. Although much work remains to be done in this area, we describe consistently observed biases that should be taken into account when analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In this article, we review current knowledge about these biases, discuss their impact on analysis results, and propose solutions.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Accurate identification of genotypes is an essential part of the analysis of genomic data, including in identification of sequence polymorphisms, linking mutations with disease and determining mutation rates. Biological and technical processes that adversely affect genotyping include copy-number-variation, paralogous sequences, library preparation, sequencing error and reference-mapping biases, among others.

Results
We modeled the read depth for all data as a mixture of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, resulting in significant improvements over previously used models. In most cases the best model was comprised of two distributions. The major-component distribution is similar to a binomial distribution with low error and low reference bias. The minor-component distribution is overdispersed with higher error and reference bias. We also found that sites fitting the minor component are enriched for copy number variants and low complexity regions, which can produce erroneous genotype calls. By removing sites that do not fit the major component, we can improve the accuracy of genotype calls.
