	abstract = {As sequencing technologies become more affordable, it is now realistic to propose studying the evolutionary history of virtually any organism on a genomic scale. However, when dealing with non-model organisms it is not always easy to choose the best approach given a specific biological question, a limited budget, and challenging sample material. Furthermore, although recent advances in technology offer unprecedented opportunities for research in non-model organisms, they also demand unprecedented awareness from the researcher regarding the assumptions and limitations of each method. In this review we present an overview of the current sequencing technologies and the methods used in typical high-throughput data analysis pipelines. Subsequently, we contextualize high-throughput {DNA} sequencing technologies within their applications in non-model organism biology. We include tips regarding managing unconventional sample material, comparative and population genetic approaches that do not require fully assembled genomes, and advice on how to deal with low depth sequencing data.},

High-throughput sequencing is fast and inexpensive, making it accessible for a wide range of research topics. However, the produced data contain subtle but complex types of errors, biases and uncertainties that impose several statistical and computational challenges to the reliable detection of variants. To tap the full potential of high-throughput sequencing, a thorough understanding of the data produced as well as the available methodologies is required. Here, I review several commonly used methods for generating and processing next-generation resequencing data, discuss the influence of errors and biases together with their resulting implications for downstream analyses and provide general guidelines and recommendations for producing high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphism data sets from raw reads by highlighting several sophisticated reference-based methods representing the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {Motivation
The standard protocol for detecting variation in {DNA} is to map millions of short sequence reads to a known reference and find loci that differ. While this approach works well, it cannot be applied where the sample contains dense variants or is too distant from known references. De novo assembly or hybrid methods can recover genomic variation, but the cost of computation is often much higher. We developed a novel k-mer algorithm and software implementation, Kestrel, capable of characterizing densely packed {SNPs} and large indels without mapping, assembly or de Bruijn graphs.

Results
When applied to mosaic penicillin binding protein ({PBP}) genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we found near perfect concordance with assembled contigs at a fraction of the {CPU} time. Multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}) with this approach was able to bypass de novo assemblies. Kestrel has a very low false-positive rate when applied to the whole genome, and while Kestrel identified many variants missed by other methods, limitations of a purely k-mer based approach affect overall sensitivity.

	abstract = {Restriction site Associated {DNA} Sequencing ({RAD}-Seq) is a technique characterized by the sequencing of specific loci along the genome that is widely employed in the field of evolutionary biology since it allows to exploit variants (mainly Single Nucleotide Polymorphism—{SNPs}) information from entire populations at a reduced cost. Common {RAD} dedicated tools, such as {STACKS} or {IPyRAD}, are based on all-vs-all read alignments, which require consequent time and computing resources. We present an original method, {DiscoSnp}-{RAD}, that avoids this pitfall since variants are detected by exploiting specific parts of the assembly graph built from the reads, hence preventing all-vs-all read alignments. We tested the implementation on simulated datasets of increasing size, up to 1,000 samples, and on real {RAD}-Seq data from 259 specimens of Chiastocheta flies, morphologically assigned to seven species. All individuals were successfully assigned to their species using both {STRUCTURE} and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, identified variants succeeded to reveal a within-species genetic structure linked to the geographic distribution. Furthermore, our results show that {DiscoSnp}-{RAD} is significantly faster than state-of-the-art tools. The overall results show that {DiscoSnp}-{RAD} is suitable to identify variants from {RAD}-Seq data, it does not require time-consuming parameterization steps and it stands out from other tools due to its completely different principle, making it substantially faster, in particular on large datasets.},

On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping.
